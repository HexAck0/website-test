    programming and all that stuff, from front-end to back-end.

<ul>
    <li>Front-end
        <ol>
            <li>HTML
            <li>CSS
        </ol>
        <li>Back-end and database
            <ol>
                <li>Javascript
                 <li>MySQL
                <li>PHP   
            </ol>
